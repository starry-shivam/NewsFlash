<h1 align="center">News Flashâš¡</h1>

A simple android app which shows you latest headlines using [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and demonstrates a simple [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview) Implimentation in Android.

<b>Tech stack</b>
- 100% written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) the official language of android.
- [Volley](https://google.github.io/volley/) library for making API calls.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) library loading images into ImageView.
- [CustomTabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/) for showing in-app news web view.

I built this app mainly to learn how RecyclerView works in android, so it doesn't have too much features as of yet, just basic scroll view for top news headlines in India. (Yes country is hardcoded.)
